## Avatar Images

This is the correct folder to place your avatar images.

1.  Add your image files (e.g., `avatar1.png`, `my-cool-pic.jpg`) to this directory.
2.  Open the file `src/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`.
3.  Find the `avatarOptions` array.
4.  Update the array with the paths to your new images. For example: `'/avatars/avatar1.png'`.
