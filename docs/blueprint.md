## Core Features:

- Image Transition: Display a central image (lightning bolts) that transitions to the top-left corner after 1.7 seconds.
- Glassmorphic Container: Overlay a glassmorphic container in the center of the screen when the image starts to transition.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Violet (#9400D3) for a modern, tech-forward aesthetic. Inspired by the color violet, representing imagination and originality.
- Background color: Very light pink (#F8E8FF), derived from the primary color's hue but highly desaturated and light to provide a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Rose (#FF007F), analogous to violet but with greater saturation and brightness to highlight elements. Gradient from primary color violet to the accent color Rose will serve as the background
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for all text elements to maintain a clean, modern interface.
- The main image (lightning bolts) will be initially centered on the screen.
- A CSS transition will move the image to the top-left corner smoothly.
- The glassmorphic container will appear simultaneously with the image's movement to the top-left, creating a coordinated effect.
